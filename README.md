DF_SD
==============================

## SD implementation of DreamFusion

This code has several subparts. One of them is modification of the multinerf codebase with the modification mentioned in the paper. 

The modifications are located [here](src/tertiary/multinerf/README.md)

Things which are done so far:
- MIP NERF Modifications
    - Architectural changes based on Apendix A2
    - Hyper Paramter regularized added
        - Changed the gradiant to stop for the orientation loss
- Stable Diffusion
    - Added the stable diffusion code based on Github repo [here](https://github.com/patil-suraj/stable-diffusion-jax.git)
